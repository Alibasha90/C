There are 4 main types of preprocessor directives:-

   1)Macros
   2)File Inclusion
   3)Conditional Compilation
   4)Other directives

Macros:-
	 Macros are a piece of code in a program which is given some name. Whenever this name is encountered by the compiler the compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code. The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro.


#include <stdio.h> 
  
// macro definition 
#define LIMIT 5 
int main() 
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i < LIMIT; i++) { 
        printf("%d \n",i); 
    } 
  
    return 0; 
}
