here i have taken the program and there i started compile it throgh the fatal error ..

because myheader was not include in path here we can 2 thing:-

1) include path 
2) compile by include all inclusion files
	ex:- gcc -c *.c I.
	I ---> means include the present working directory.
	. ---> present working directory.

+ in the program myheader.h is statically linked at linker stage.
	add.c sub.c myheader.h all static 
+ dynamic linking is printf function and atol function.

how dynamically linked ?
